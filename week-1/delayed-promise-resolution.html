Promise that resolves after set time

Create a function that has one parameter: resolveAfter. Calling this function will return a promise that resolves after the resolveAfter seconds has passed.

Here is an example: makeUpYourOwnFunctionName(3) will return a promise that resolves after 3 seconds.

Use the makeUpYourOwnFunctionName to log out the string I am called asynchronously after 6 seconds.
