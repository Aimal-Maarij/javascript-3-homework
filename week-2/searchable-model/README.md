## SearchableModel

There are two things to do in this exercise:
1. fill in all the empty code in SearchableModel-extension.js. if your code works there will be no assert messages in console when you open test-it.html.  
2. fill in the missing lines of use-it.html so all the asserts pass

the SearchableModel-extension.js class already contains several static methods that will be very helpful to you, be sure to study them!

You'll certainly encounter plenty of errors. that's awesome!  all the more chance to practice reading stack traces and handling errors

If you find it too challenging to write all the methods from scratch, no problemo!  This assignment is as much about studying and using code written by someone else as it is about writing your own code.  
Take a look at SearchableModel-to-study.js.  This contains code for a fully-functional SearchableModel that you can study and try out before writing your own.    
All of the methods in this example are written with for loops.  If you do study this code (which is encouraged if you need it!), we only ask that you write your solution using native Array methods (like .filter, or .find) instead of for loops. the code is there to study, not to copy ;)


after you've passed all the tests, move on to use-it.html and fill in the missing lines of code to pass the asserts.
